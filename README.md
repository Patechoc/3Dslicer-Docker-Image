# Building Slicer3 with Docker

This repository contains a Dockerfile that builds Slicer 4.4 on top of Ubuntu 14.04 following 3DSlicer instructions ([Slicer4:Build Instructions](http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Build_Instructions)).

All dependencies are taken care of and [Docker](www.docker.com) makes further development quick and easy.
